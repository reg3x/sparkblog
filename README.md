# SparkBlog #

This is a repository of the blog I'm building for my personal use. Currently it is still at the first stage of development, it is not yet suitable for production. Feel free to fork and reuse if you please. 
It's built using:

* Spark MicroWeb Framework 
* Freemarker for templates 
* Mongodb for the database
