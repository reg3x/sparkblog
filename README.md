# SparkBlog #

This is the repository of a blog I'm building for my personal use. Currently it is still at the first stage of development, it is not yet suitable for production. Feel free to fork and reuse if you please. 
It's built using:

* [Spark](sparkjava.com) MicroWeb Framework 
* [Freemarker](freemarker.org) for templates 
* [Mongodb](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java/) for the database
