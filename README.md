# SparkBlog #

This is the repository of a blog I'm building for my personal use. Currently it is still at the first stage of development, it is not yet suitable for production.  
It's being built using:

* [Spark](sparkjava.com) MicroWeb Framework 
* [Freemarker](freemarker.org) for templates 
* [Mongodb](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java/) for the database
